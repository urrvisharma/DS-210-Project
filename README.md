The project examines a Twitter dataset (81,306 nodes, 1,768,149 edges) by reading data, creating a graph, and using breadth-first search for connectivity analysis. The "graph" module functions find shortest, longest paths, and average distance. The main function allows user input for connection analysis.

The code is interactive, and once it is run, will prompt the user to input 2 user IDs at first. Once it finds the min and max distance of the two IDs, it will prompt the user one more time to enter one ID. It will then find the average distance from that ID to all of the other IDs in the graph.

The user can find that IDs are available in the twitter_combined.txt file. I have also provided some possible IDs that can be used in the program here: 178852084 228078044, 197668807 234047967, 86799233 57730647, 61693492 271602109, 519072110 44473103, 185787222 281707984, 7398912 276597679, 93579404 104585489, 79721137 49636316, 8362812 17132311, 17179687 251324837, 127492024 27855118, 33832991 16886225, 30678185 105656576 Any of these IDs can be used in any order.

If you wish to view the full list of Twitter IDs used for this project, it is available in the src file called "twitter_combined.txt"

Enjoy!!
